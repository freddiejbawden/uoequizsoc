                 <span>Each month, we our monthly Pub Quiz. Over 6 rounds teams of up to 6 people compete for prizes and glory.
                 Anyone can attend, costing only Â£1 per team with prizes up for grabs for first, second, third places.
                 As our rounds are written by society members we enjoy a variety of different subjects at our quizzes. Along with the
                 typical topics: General Knowledge, Music and Geography and History, we also have some more unusual rounds; these can be anything:
                 Food and Drink, Bad Movie Descriptions or Dinosaur Anatomy.
                   </span>
                <!--  <span>Our next monthly pub quiz is: </span> -->

                <span class="subheader"> Buzzer Evenings </span><br />
                <span>Every week, alternating Wednesdays and Thursdays, we run a free buzzer quizzing session for anyone who wishes to attend. The evening takes
                the same format as University Challenge,
                as attendees race against opposing teams to answer questions about a huge number of topics.
                This is a chance for members to get to know the society members in a smaller group and to try their hand at different styles of questions without the
                pressure of a serious environment. Afterwards, we usually head over to either the Frankenstein's Quiz (Wednesday)
                or Southsider's Quiz (Thursday) as a group, to put our warmed up minds to good use!

                  As well as organising pub quizzes and quizbowl tournaments,
                  EUQS also handles Edinburgh's applications to iconic BBC quiz
                  show University Challenge. We have done well in recent years,
                  making the semifinals in the 16-17 and 17-18 series, and we
                  have a team in the current 18-19 series. If you want to show
                  off your knowledge on TV, you should apply! Going on the show
                  is great fun and very rewarding.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The process starts every year in late October, where we run a
                  huge paper-based quiz for anyone to attend. This year's  quiz
                  will be held on Wednesday 24th October 2018, 3-4pm, George
                  Square Lecture Theatre.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The top sixteen quizzers then go to a live buzzer round held
                     a couple of weeks after. This takes the form of some
                     starter questions played as individuals, followed by a
                     mock University Challenge match. A panel of quiz experts
                     (typically the EUQS President, two members of the previous
                     year's University Challenge team, and a representative from
                      EUSA) select the four members of the team. After that,
                      there's an interview with the producers, and after that
                      you're on the show!

                <span class="subheader">Monthly Pub Quiz</span><br />
                 <span>Each month, we our monthly Pub Quiz. Over 6 rounds teams of up to 6 people compete for prizes and glory.
                 Anyone can attend, costing only Â£1 per team with prizes up for grabs for first, second, third places.
                 As our rounds are written by society members we enjoy a variety of different subjects at our quizzes. Along with the
                 typical topics: General Knowledge, Music and Geography and History, we also have some more unusual rounds; these can be anything:
                 Food and Drink, Bad Movie Descriptions or Dinosaur Anatomy.
                   </span>

                <span class="subheader"> Buzzer Evenings </span><br />
                <span>Every week, alternating Wednesdays and Thursdays, we run a free buzzer quizzing session for anyone who wishes to attend. The evening takes
                the same format as University Challenge,
                as attendees race against opposing teams to answer questions about a huge number of topics.
                This is a chance for members to get to know the society members in a smaller group and to try their hand at different styles of questions without the
                pressure of a serious environment. Afterwards, we usually head over to either the Frankenstein's Quiz (Wednesday)
                or Southsider's Quiz (Thursday) as a group, to put our warmed up minds to good use!
